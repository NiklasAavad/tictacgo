# Tic Tac Go!

Challenge your friends in a online game of tic tac toe. You can even play against whoever is available through the game lobby. Or if there are nobody around, there's at least always the oppertunity to play against the good old computer.

## Chat
Make the game even more interesting by chatting inbetween the rounds. However, if you are in the mood for a silent game of tic tac toe, you can always go in zen-mode and have the chat messages muted.
